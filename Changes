TO DO:

* Add configuration via Config::Items, so a .rcfile and command
  line options work out of the box
* Add configuration item for the Growl target
* Add configuration item for the FritzBox
* Consider adding CSS selector scraping in addition to XPath scraping
* Make reverse lookup testable through canned files
* Consider reading the country code / area code config from the Fritz!Box
  (would need a password for the FB)
* Consider moving all the URLs+country codes into a config file instead
  of keeping them in the module
* Move reconnect logic into "exponential falloff" module
